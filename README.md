# vote_report
This project aims to scrape data from the Kujira finder webpage, query a selected validator, and return True if the last transaction was a vote. Otherwise, it returns False.

Future functionalities include: 
  1. Returning a list of all votes from a selected validator in history.
  2. Alerting users whenever a validator makes a new vote, supplying the content of that vote.
